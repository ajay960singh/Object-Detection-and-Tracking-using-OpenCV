    "3. Filter : In some cases, `HoughCircles` outputs false positives for a baseball at the bottom of the bat, which is also circular. This can be filtered out in a number of ways- by using greyscale intensities or positions. In our case, we use positions, i.e., we introduced a variable `leftmost`, which represents the leftmost cirle and assumes that the ball is always travelling in the left direction and any detection to the right of this variable is ignored. This gives the correct location for the baseball."
